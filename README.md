Description:

Publicitaki is a comprehensive price tracking system that tracks the price of products from different stores. The system comprises three distinct subsystems - Publicitaki, Store, and Bank - that communicate with each other through a variety of communication protocols such as REST, gRPC, and Publish/Subscribe pattern.

The Publicitaki subsystem acts as a central price tracker that collects and compares product prices from various stores. The Store subsystem is responsible for selling products to customers and updating product prices to the Publicitaki subsystem. The Bank subsystem manages banking transactions between the two systems.

The system uses multiple types of databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB, to store and manage data. Both relational and non-relational databases are used to optimize data storage and retrieval.

The system is implemented using multiple programming languages and frameworks, including Java (Spring Boot and Quarkus), C# (ASP.NET), JavaScript (React, NodeJS), and Python (Django). The use of different languages and frameworks enables the system to optimize performance, scalability, and reliability.

The system's communication protocols, database management, and programming languages were chosen to ensure that the system is highly scalable, efficient, and secure. The Publicitaki price tracking system is a powerful tool for stores to manage prices effectively and improve their revenue.
